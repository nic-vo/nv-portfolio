## About

A JavaScript / React calculator I created for [freeCodeCamp's front-end certificate]. refactored from React class components to functional components with hooks. The calculator was relatively simple to program, but it was interesting trying to account for every functional edge case including, among others:
- inserting previous answers into calculations
- preventing multiple decimal points in a number
- allowing negative numbers
- overriding previous operators
